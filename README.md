# Agriculture

Agriculture will be the main focus of this modpack, as you can tell by the **Garden** part of the title! At the moment, there's not a ton of polish or tweaks to just the default mods that add farming things, but there's plans for quests, advancements and a much more custom farming experience. There's currently already some complexity with [Serene Seasons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/serene-seasons) and much more content with [Pam's Harvestcraft 2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pams-harvestcraft-2-crops) and [Simple Farming](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-farming). 

# Animal Husbandry

Do you like the idea of having more complexity to ranching in the game than the current system of either mob crushers or just basic fenced in areas? Well, me to because Minecraft animals such as cows, sheep and pigs can get a little stale sometimes. With the [Quark](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quark) mod, one of the features it gives us is the Feeding Trough. This handy little early game item can automatically breed animals for you, so you can focus on more important things _(like growing tomatoes of course)_. Just input the animal's feed of choice _(currently only support for vanilla crops)_ and come back when you're hungry for some protein. Maybe you'd rather leave the animals alone and go more vegetarian, in which case [Productive Bees](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/productivebees) will be more up you're ally. 

There's plans to look into ways to make the **Ranch** part of **Garden Ranch** feel more exciting, but feel free to leave some feedback or ideas as an [issue](https://github.com/danielMoreland00/GardenRanch/issues). 

# Automation

What would a modpack all about farming crops and animals be without some type of automation? Although not the main focus, there's elements of automations such as with the [Create](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) mod. It encompasses that early vibe feel that this modpack aims to give you, and isn't overly complex _(unless you want it to be, of course)_ and felt like a perfect addition. There's other little things here and there like the adorable [Straw golems](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/strawgolem-reborn) that'll help you out with the menial chores around your farm as you try building your infrastructure up.

# Food

Everyone loves food, right? Well thankfully there's a TON of food for you to craft and munch on. [Cooking for Blockheads](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cooking-for-blockheads) lets you take full advantage of all those recipes by drastically lowering the mental load of trying to find all those pesky ingredients in the form of multiblock kitchens. Why bother eating more than a baked potato? Well I'll tell you why. When you first start off in your world, you'll be but a feeble weak farmer, but through eating a diverse diet _(thanks to both spice of life [carrot](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/spice-of-life-carrot-edition) and [potato](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/spice-of-life-potato-edition) editions)_ you can become more hardy and even get better loot thanks to the buffs the player gets from eating different food items. Who knows, maybe if you eat enough different items, you'll even get better loot?
